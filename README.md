# GoFetch-Reinforcment-Learning
A small project for me learn RL with a sample problem of an agent that need to fetch a ball and return it

For interactive playing (human playing) run 'interactive_play.py'

For RL to solve the game run 'solve_game.py'. 

Use Deep one of the three alternatives method: Q-Learning or standard Q-learning or monte-carlo.
